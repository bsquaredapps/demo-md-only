# Chapter 4

## Section 1

### General

**Revision: C-58, September 20, 2019**

1. Provider Certification Criteria
   
    Refer to the [32 CFR 199.6](../fr16/c6TOC.html\#FM92542) and the TRICARE Policy Manual (TPM), [Chapters 1](../tp15/c1TOC.html\#FM734932) and [11](../tp15/c11TOC.html\#FM309455). All providers shall be TRICARE certified in accordance with the TPM. Network providers shall be credentialed in accordance with nationally accepted credentialing standards adopted by a national accrediting body. “Authorized Provider” is any provider who meets the requirements set forth in [32 CFR 199.6](../fr16/c6TOC.html\#FM92542) and in the TPM, [Chapters 1](../tp15/c1TOC.html\#FM734932) and [11](../tp15/c11TOC.html\#FM309455). If a beneficiary submits a claim for services provided by a non-participating individual professional provider who is known to be legally practicing and is eligible for TRICARE-authorization, the provider shall be certified and payment shall be made to the beneficiary. In no case shall a provider who refuses to provide proper Social Security Number (SSN)/Employer Identification Number (EIN) identification be paid directly.  I'm adding a new line to clarify a previous statement.

2. Provider Approvals
   
   1. The contractor shall accurately authorize all providers of care using a single, centralized authorization process. The contractors shall ensure that all providers of care for whom a billing is made or claim submitted under TRICARE meet all conditions, limitations or exclusions specified or enumerated in 32 CFR 199, the TPM, and the TRICARE Operations Manual (TOM). The contractor shall maintain separate institutional and non-institutional provider files. Additions, deletions, and changes to these files, shall be reported to Defense Health Agency (DHA) as specified in the TRICARE Systems Manual (TSM).
   
   2. Upon receipt of a claim or request for provider certification information involving a provider practicing in the contractor’s jurisdiction but not on the TRICARE Encounter Provider (TEPRV) file, the contractor shall contact the provider, the state licensing board, the appropriate national or professional association, or other sources to determine that the provider meets certification requirements. The contractor may establish eligibility for certification by any of these means. Documentation may be a copy of the page from the most recent state licensor listings, screen print from on-line access to state board licensing files, or other methods that show proof that the provider meets the certification requirements.
   
   3. I made a difference. The provider is later determined to be authorized based on receipt of the required documentation, claims may be reopened and processed if requested by the provider or beneficiary.
   
   4. Services delivered by any provider must be within the scope of the license or other legal authorization. The contractor shall maintain a current computer listing of all certified providers, including at a minimum the data required by the TSM, [Chapter 2, Section 2.10](../ts15/c2s2\_10.html\#FM65624). If the provider was initially certified by the contractor, the certification shall be supported by a documented and readily accessible hardcopy or electronic file documenting each provider’s qualifications. A hardcopy or electronic file documenting the provider’s existence on the TEPRV shall be maintained for all other providers.
   
   5. Any provider who has not submitted a claim or whose services have not been submitted on a claim within the past two years may be moved from the active file to the inactive file. However, even if the provider remains on the active file, if a claim is received from a provider who has not submitted a claim or whose services have not been submitted on a claim within the past two years, the provider must be fully recertified. Providers who have been terminated or suspended shall not be deleted. Suspended or terminated, or excluded providers shall remain on the file as flagged providers indefinitely or until the flag is dropped because the suspended provider has been reinstated. The contractor shall review all providers that have been flagged to ensure the flags are working at a minimum of once each year. To do this, the contractor shall maintain records of all suspended and terminated providers and audit the provider file flags and, as necessary, test to ensure they are operational.
   
   6. The contractor shall accept the Medicare certification of individual professional providers who have a like class of individual professional providers under TRICARE without further authorization unless there is information indicating Medicare, TRICARE or other federal health care program integrity violations by the physician or other health care practitioner. Certification of individual professional providers without a like class (e.g., chiropractors) under TRICARE shall be denied.

3. Part-Time Physician Employees Of The Department Of Veterans Affairs (DVA)/Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
   
   1. The Director, DHA, has authorized an exception, on a case-by-case basis, to the TRICARE policy which excludes any civilian employee of the DVA/VHA from certification as a TRICARE provider. This exception is for part-time physician (MD) employees only who file claims for service furnished in their private, non-DVA/VHA employment practice.
   
   2. In order to be considered as a certified provider, the DVA/VHA facility administrator must send a request for an exception to the appropriate contractor ([Addendum A, Figure 4.A-1](c4adA.html\#FM49833)) along with a Part-Time Physician Employee Provider Certification Form ([Addendum A, Figure 4.A-2](c4adA.html\#FM56619)) signed by the physician. Upon receipt of these two documents, the contractor shall approve the physician as a TRICARE provider for services furnished by this provider in his private practice. The effective date is the date the contractor approves the waiver. The contractor shall notify the physician and requesting DVA/VHA facility by letter of the approval and the effective date. No retroactive approval dates shall be allowed. All claims from these providers shall be annotated on the signature block of the claim form, “additional certification on file”.

4.0 Vendors Of Medical Supplies, Durable Medical Equipment (DME), Or Durable Equipment (DE)

Medical supplies, DME, or DE otherwise allowable as a Basic Program or authorized Extended Care Health Option (ECHO) benefit purchased from an approved vendor (TPM, [Chapter 11, Section 9.1](../tp15/c11s9\_1.html\#FM68771)), may be cost-shared (currently or retroactively) when payment is made directly to the beneficiary.
